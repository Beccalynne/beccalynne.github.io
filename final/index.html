        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Wholesome Harvest farm was established January of 2019. Located on 16 acres North of Mead yet South of Deer Park.  We started the farm to get closer to our food and show our kids how to care for and raise animals. The farm currently houses cows, chickens, ducks, pigs, and goats. Our chickens and ducks are free range. We specialize in organic fruit, vegetables, and meat. We have three different breeds of pigs which include Kunekune, Berkshire, and Glochesterire old spot.  There is no hormones or pesticides used with our animals or produce. In the fall the pumpkin patch is a perfect activity with the kids being able to pick out a pumpkin and go on a hay ride.</p>
