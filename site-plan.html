    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <h4>Heading Font: Raleway</h4>
    <p>This an easy to read font for headings and so the audience can see the different amenities offered and can search a specific one if they are looking for something in particular. It also is slightly bolded which will attract the eye for an easy glance until the audience sees what they want to investigate further.</p>
    <h4>Paragraph Font: Open Sans Condensed</h4>
    <p>It is a little more informal and not bolded to not take away from the heading. Even though it is less formal it is still easily read to those of all ages.</p>
    <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
    <p>We offer a complete package for whatever your needs are in relation to temple service and accomodations. Our shuttle runs to meet the endowment schedule and our babysitting servcies provide an afforable and safe alternative for your family.</p>
    <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
    <p class="colored">Plan on using our free changing room for you and your fellow patrons as you transition from traveling to the temple to actually entering the temple. We want you to feel comfortable changing and freshing up in order to focus on meaningful service. Let us take care of you.</p>
